# E-commerce Website

This project is an e-commerce website designed to help businesses sell their products online.

## How it Helped During COVID-19

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses faced challenges due to lockdowns and social distancing measures. This e-commerce platform provided a crucial solution by enabling businesses to:

*   **Reach customers online:** Businesses could continue to operate and sell their products even when physical stores were closed or had restricted access.
*   **Adapt to changing consumer behavior:** With more people shopping online, this platform helped businesses meet the growing demand for online purchasing options.
*   **Ensure business continuity:** By having an online presence, businesses could maintain their operations and revenue streams during a difficult time.

This website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes features for browsing products, adding items to a cart, and making purchases.

## Getting Started

To use this project, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Website Structure

The website includes the following main pages and sections:

*   **`index.html`**: The homepage of the e-commerce site.
*   **`products/`**: This directory contains various product categories and individual product pages. Users can browse items here.
*   **`catbrand.html`**: Likely a page to display product categories or brands.
*   **`aboutus.html`**: Provides information about the business or the platform.
*   **`contact.php`**: A contact page, likely with a form for users to send messages. This suggests a PHP backend might be used for form processing.
*   **`submission.html`**: This could be a page displayed after a form submission, for example, after a user places an order or sends a contact message.
*   **`location.html`**: This page might display the physical location of the business or shipping information.
*   **`error.html`**: A page to display error messages to the user.

## Technologies Used

This website is built using a combination of front-end technologies:

*   **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** Used for structuring the content of the web pages.
*   **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Used for styling the visual presentation of the website. This includes the use of the **Bootstrap** framework (`css/bootstrap.css` and related files) for responsive design and pre-built UI components. Custom styles are likely in `css/style.css`.
*   **JavaScript:** Used for interactive elements and client-side functionality. Bootstrap components also rely on JavaScript (`js/bootstrap.bundle.js`).
*   **PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor):** The presence of `contact.php` and `message.php` strongly indicates that PHP is used on the server-side, likely for handling contact form submissions or other dynamic interactions.

The project also includes a `scss/` directory, suggesting that **Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)**, a CSS preprocessor, was used during development for more maintainable and organized stylesheets.
